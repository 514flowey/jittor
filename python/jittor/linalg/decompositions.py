    named ``(U, S, Vh)`` result as ``torch.linalg.svd`` (and it also unpacks as
    a plain 3-tuple ``u, s, v``, preserving every existing jittor caller).

    For ``A`` of shape ``(...,M,N)`` with ``K = min(M, N)``:

    - ``full_matrices=False`` (default, reduced / "thin"): ``U`` is ``(...,M,K)``,
      ``Vh`` is ``(...,K,N)``, ``S`` is ``(...,K)``.
    - ``full_matrices=True``: ``U`` is ``(...,M,M)``, ``Vh`` is ``(...,N,N)``,
      ``S`` is ``(...,K)``.

    .. note::
        ``torch.linalg.svd`` defaults to ``full_matrices=True``; this jittor-
        native entry point keeps the historical reduced default so that the
        differentiable path and all jittor callers (``matrix_rank``/``cond``/
        ``matrix_norm``/the native ``test_linalg`` suite) are unchanged. Pass

        facing ``torch.linalg.svd`` default is meant to be supplied at the
        torch-compat boundary.)

    ``S`` is sorted in descending order. The reduced form (and the square case,
    where reduced == full) is differentiable; the full form on a *non-square*
    matrix is computed via numpy without a gradient on ``U``/``Vh`` (the extra
    orthogonal-complement columns/rows have no unique gradient) — use
    ``full_matrices=False`` or :func:`svdvals` when gradients are needed.
